Project:
        Air Quality Analysis


Problem Statement:
        The project aims to analyze and visualize air quality data from monitoring stations in
        Tamil Nadu. The objective is to gain insights into air pollution trends, identify areas
        with high pollution levels, and develop a predictive model to estimate RSPM/PM10 levels
        based on SO2 and NO2 levels. This project involves defining objectives, designing the
        analysis approach, selecting visualization techniques, and creating a predictive model
        using Python and relevant libraries.


Approach:
        Design Thinking:
                Project Objectives: Define objectives such as analyzing air quality trends,
                        identifying pollution hotspots, and building a predictive model for
                        RSPM/PM10 levels.
                Analysis Approach: Plan the steps to load, preprocess, analyze, and visualize
                        the air quality data.
                Visualization Selection: Determine visualization techniques (e.g., line charts, heatmaps)
                        to effectively represent air quality trends and pollution levels.


        Checking the requirements:
            First we install the required software and install the modules required for the
            project and then we set up the test environment by changing the path variables
            and we launch the application.
        
        Data collection and warehousing:
            We collect various data in the form of an excel spreadsheet and convert it into
            a CSV file and save it in the same folder where we are going to implement the algorithm.
        
        Test execution:
            We use the pandas,scikit,matplotlib modules in python in order to implement the supervised
            machine learning algorithm and to visualize it in a realistic manner.


Conclusion:
    These steps are considered optimal for getting the desired output.
